# wordpress-export-to-markdown

This is a fork of the repository https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown customized for converting the old mozestudio.com journal to MDX.

---

Converts a WordPress export file into Markdown files that are compatible with static site generators ([Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), etc.).

Each post is saved as a separate Markdown file with frontmatter. Images are downloaded and saved.

## Quick Start

You'll need:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
-   Your [WordPress export file](https://wordpress.org/support/article/tools-export-screen/) (be sure to export "All content").

To make things easier, you can rename your WordPress export file to `export.xml` and drop it into the same directory that you run this script from.

You can run this script immediately in your terminal with `npx`:

```
npx wordpress-export-to-markdown
```

Or you can clone this repo, then from within the repo's directory, install and run:

```
npm install && node index.js
```

Either way, the script will start a wizard to configure your options. Answer the questions and off you go!

## Command Line

Options can also be configured via the command line. The wizard will skip asking about any such options. For example, the following will give you [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-style output in terms of folder structure and filenames.

Using `npx`:

```
npx wordpress-export-to-markdown --post-folders=false --prefix-date=true
```

Using a locally cloned repo:

```
node index.js --post-folders=false --prefix-date=true
```

The wizard will still ask you about any options not specified on the command line. To skip the wizard entirely and use default values for unspecified options, add `--wizard=false`.

## Options

These are the questions asked by the wizard. Command line arguments, along with their default values, are also being provided here if you want to use them.

### Path to WordPress export file?

**Command line:** `--input=export.xml`

The path to your WordPress export file. To make things easier, you can rename your WordPress export file to `export.xml` and drop it into the same directory that you run this script from.

### Path to output folder?

**Command line:** `--output=output`

The path to the output directory where Markdown and image files will be saved. If it does not exist, it will be created.

### Create year folders?

**Command line:** `--year-folders=false`

Whether or not to organize output files into folders by year.

### Create month folders?

**Command line:** `--month-folders=false`

Whether or not to organize output files into folders by month. You'll probably want to combine this with `--year-folders` to organize files by year then month.

### Create a folder for each post?

**Command line:** `--post-folders=true`

Whether or not to save files and images into post folders.

If `true`, the post slug is used for the folder name and the post's Markdown file is named `index.md`. Each post folder will have its own `/images` folder.

    /first-post
        /images
            potato.png
        index.md
    /second-post
        /images
            carrot.jpg
            celery.jpg
        index.md

If `false`, the post slug is used to name the post's Markdown file. These files will be side-by-side and images will go into a shared `/images` folder.

    /images
        carrot.jpg
        celery.jpg
        potato.png
    first-post.md
    second-post.md

Either way, this can be combined with with `--year-folders` and `--month-folders`, in which case the above output will be organized under the appropriate year and month folders.

### Prefix post folders/files with date?

**Command line:** `--prefix-date=false`

Whether or not to prepend the post date to the post slug when naming a post's folder or file.

If `--post-folders` is `true`, this affects the folder.

    /2019-10-14-first-post
        index.md
    /2019-10-23-second-post
        index.md

If `--post-folders` is `false`, this affects the file.

    2019-10-14-first-post.md
    2019-10-23-second-post.md

### Save images attached to posts?

**Command line:** `--save-attached-images=true`

Whether or not to download and save images attached to posts. Generally speaking, these are images that were uploaded by using **Add Media** or **Set Featured Image** in WordPress. Images are saved into `/images`.

### Save images scraped from post body content?

**Command line:** `--save-scraped-images=true`

Whether or not to download and save images scraped from `<img>` tags in post body content. Images are saved into `/images`. The `<img>` tags are updated to point to where the images are saved.

### Include custom post types and pages?

**Command line:** `--include-other-types=false`

Some WordPress sites make use of a `"page"` post type and/or custom post types. Set this to `true` to include these post types in the output. Posts will be organized into post type folders.

## Customizing Frontmatter and Other Advanced Settings

You can edit [settings.js](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown/blob/master/src/settings.js) to configure advanced settings beyond the options above. This includes things like customizing frontmatter, date formatting, throttling image downloads, and more.

You'll need to run the script locally (not using `npx`) to edit these advanced settings.
